# learning-d3
My mini projects on my journey from D3 novice to...something more than a novice.  

To view any of these webpages, you need to host these folders on a server, as d3 doesn't allow files to be read over the local filesystem.

I simply run
```python3 -m http.server```
from the project's directory and call it good.
