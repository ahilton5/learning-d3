# learning-d3
My mini projects on my journal from novice to (hopefully soon) expert.  

To view any of these webpages, you need to host these folders on a server, as d3 doesn't allow files to be read over the local filesystem.

I simply run
```python3 -m http.server```
from the project's directory and call it good.
